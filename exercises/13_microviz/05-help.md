## Seeking help

If you face some trouble with some function, let's say `summary()`, you can always type `?summary()`
and a help page will be displayed with useful information regarding that function. Furthermore, if you
already know what you want to do, but you do not know which function to use, you can type `??` 
following your inquiry, for example `??barplot` will open a help file in the RStudio's help
panel in the lower right corner.

With this, we have the needed tools to begin our exploration of diversity with R. That does not mean that we have already covered all that R have to offer, if you want to know more about R, we recommend you to check the [R lesson for Reproducible genomic analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/). 
Let's continue and see what this journey has to offer.
