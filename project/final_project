Final Project

Overview: This semester you embarked on a bioinformatics journey to analyze fecal microbial transplant (FMT) samples from donors and recipients to determine if the donor microbiome could be transmitted to a recipient with C. difficile infection. For the final project, we are going to take this one step further to analyze the data. Please select 3 of your favorite figures from the homework assignments (or 1 for undergraduates) and write up a short methods and results section for each figure. Next, summarize your major findings from these figures in a short discussion. 

Materials and Methods (1 paragraph per figure): M&M provides the context for evaluating data. How did you obtain the data? What tools and parameters were used? What protocols did you use? What would another scientist need to know to reproduce your work?

Results (1 paragraph per figure): The results section should (1) summarize the data emphasizing the important trends or patterns, and (2) illustrate and support your generalizations with explanatory details (referencing the figure). Do not just repeat data that is already included in the figure. Instead, point out important information or patterns that you want to draw attention to. 

Discussion (summary of results): In the results section you reported your findings; now, in the discussion you need to tell the reader what the findings mean. Do the data support your original hypothesis? Why or why not? Refer to figures where necessary, but without reporting the data already in the results. Are your findings consistent with those reported from other researchers? How do your results fit into the bigger picture?

Figures. All Figures should be cited throughout the text and numbered consecutively.  Be sure to include a title for the Figure and a short legend. The Figures should appear at the end in a section called “Figures”.
